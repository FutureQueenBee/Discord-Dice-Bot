# Discord-Dice-Bot
Discord-Dice-Bot is a bot that allows users on [Discord][discord] chat servers to roll dice, built with [discord.py][discord.py].

This bot is designed for use by tabletop roleplayers, and its primary purpose is rolling dice. It can parse more complex rolls than other bots that can roll dice, and allows for some extra options on top of simple rolling.
