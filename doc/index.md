# Discord-Dice-Bot Docs
Discord-Dice-Bot is a bot that allows users on [Discord][discord] chat servers to roll dice.

This bot is designed for use by tabletop roleplayers, and its primary purpose is rolling dice. It can parse more complex rolls than other bots that can roll dice, and allows for some extra options on top of simple rolling.

For information on how to talk to the bot, using my instance of the bot, or running your own instance of the bot, follow a link in the appropriate section below.
